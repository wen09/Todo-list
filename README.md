# Todo-list

Tech stack:
backend:  Node.js and Express.js to build a RESTful API
database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
deployment and hosting: Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Heroku

Purpose of project: to learn necessary tech stack:
Start with Node.js: Node.js is the backbone. online resources available for learning Node.js, including the official Node.js documentation, online courses, and tutorials.
Learn a web framework: Some popular options for Node.js are Express, Koa, and Nest.js. choose one and learn the basics of creating web applications using that framework.
Learn about APIs: Once a web framework is set up, start learning about APIs. APIs are the way that frontend will interact with backend, so it's important to understand how to design and create them. There are many online resources available for learning about APIs, including tutorials, online courses, and the documentation for the web framework you choose.
Learn about databases: To store the data for to-do list. Some popular options for Node.js are MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
Learn about cloud computing: Once backend is up and running, to deploy it to a cloud service provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It's important to understand the basics of cloud computing and how to deploy application to a cloud platform.

Steps:
For to-do list app, start with a basic backend API that allows users to create and read tasks.
First, set up your project with the necessary dependencies, such as Express and Mongoose. Then, define models and routes for handling CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on tasks.
After that, test API using tools like Postman or curl to ensure it's functioning properly.

Duration: development should take 72 hours max?
